Machine learning and prediction service for Niagara NX platform. 
This module is a Niagara NX 4.9 service. Please compile it for this version. You can find the details in the pdfs.
Unfortunately some documentation is written in italian since it was a university project.
I hope this will help Niagara developers.

Hamid.
